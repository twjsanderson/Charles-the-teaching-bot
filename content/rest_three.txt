-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the 
implementation of the server can be done independently without each knowing 
about the other.

The client will send messages to the server (or API) and get responses and
metadata in standardized way.

Here is a simple diagram that outlines where RESTful principles would be used
in a modern web application.


         --->     --->       --->
Database      API      (REST)     Client
         <---     <---       <---


REST requires that a client make a request to the server in order to retrieve 
or modify data on the server. A request generally consists of:

- an HTTP verb, which defines what kind of operation to perform
- a header, which allows the client to pass along information about the request
- a path to a resource
- an optional message body containing data

In the header of the request, the client sends the type of content that it is 
able to receive from the server. This is called the Accept field, and it ensures 
that the server does not send data that cannot be understood or processed by the 
client.
