Representational State Transfer (REST) was introduced in 2000 by computer 
scientist Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation.

In the mid-1990's, use of the Web was becoming more common around the world.
As more services were being built, there was an increased need to 
standardize certain parts of the Web. Fielding was involved with creating 
some of these (including HTTP & URI).

During this time he built and tested REST as a new architectural standard 
and used it to identify architectural mismatches. He wanted to create
something with a low barrier for international adoption.

Fielding was trying to both categorize the existing architecture of the 
current implementation and identify which aspects should be considered 
central to the behavioural and performance requirements of the Web.
